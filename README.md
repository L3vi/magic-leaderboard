## Setup

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

### Individual Setup
```bash
# Backend only
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# Frontend only  
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

### How It Works
- Each branch has its own `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow file
- When you push to a branch, GitHub reads that branch's workflow file
- If the workflow's trigger branch matches the branch you pushed to, it deploys
- **All branches deploy to the same GitHub Pages URL** (last push wins)

### Current Setup
- **main**: Deploys when `main` is pushed
- **redesign**: Deploys when `redesign` is pushed
- **draft-variant**: Deploys when `draft-variant` is pushed

**⚠️ Important**: Pushing to any of these branches will overwrite what's currently live on GitHub Pages. The most recent push determines what's publicly visible.

## Development Guidelines
- Use feature branches for new features.
- Keep code modular and organized.
- Write tests for new features.
- Refactor for maintainability.
